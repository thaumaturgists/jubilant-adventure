docker-github-integration-security - Overview of security and permissions for Docker and GitHub integration
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This manual provides an overview of security practices and permission management when integrating Docker with GitHub. It is designed to help users understand how to protect their applications and data during the integration process.

.Sh COMPONENTS
.Bl -tag -width ".It" -compact
.It Access Tokens and Secrets
    Personal Access Tokens (PATs) are special keys that allow access to GitHub without using a username and password. They should have the minimum required permissions. 
    Environment Variables are used to store sensitive information securely, avoiding hardcoding in code or Dockerfiles.

.It Repository Permissions
    The Least Privilege Principle ensures users have only the permissions necessary for their tasks, minimizing risk.
    Branch Protection Rules prevent unauthorized changes to critical branches, ensuring only approved changes are merged.

.It Docker Hub and Container Registry Security
    Private Repositories keep Docker images secure by restricting access to trusted users only.
    Image Scanning tools help identify vulnerabilities in Docker images before they are used.

.It Webhooks and Automation
    Secure Webhooks validate incoming requests to ensure only authorized sources can trigger actions.
    Rate Limiting controls the number of requests to prevent service disruptions.

.It Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
    CI/CD Tools automate the building and deployment of applications, ensuring consistent and secure processes.
    Audit Logs track changes and access, providing a record for security reviews.

.It Network Security
    Firewall Rules restrict access to Docker containers, allowing only trusted sources.
    TLS/SSL encrypts data in transit, keeping communications secure.

.It Regular Updates and Patching
    Regularly updating dependencies and Docker images helps protect against known vulnerabilities.
    Automated Builds ensure that images are rebuilt with the latest updates without manual intervention.

.It Monitoring and Logging
    Logging captures important events and errors for review and troubleshooting.
    Monitoring tools provide real-time insights into the performance and security of Docker containers.
