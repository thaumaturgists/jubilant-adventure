.SH NAME
docker_setup \- Set up GitHub Actions to work with Docker

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B docker_setup
.RI [ options ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page provides a step-by-step guide to set up GitHub Actions for building and pushing Docker images to Docker Hub using GitHub secrets.

.SH STEPS

.TP
.B Step 1: Create a Docker Hub Account
Docker Hub is an online repository for storing and sharing Docker images. 
To create an account:
1. Visit the Docker Hub website: https://hub.docker.com/.
2. Sign up for a new account.

.TP
.B Step 2: Create a Repository on Docker Hub
A repository is a storage space for your Docker images.
To create a repository:
1. Log in to Docker Hub.
2. Click on "Create Repository".
3. Fill in the repository name and details, then click "Create".

.TP
.B Step 3: Store Docker Credentials as GitHub Secrets
Secrets are sensitive information that should not be shared publicly.
To store your Docker credentials:
1. Go to your GitHub repository.
2. Click on "Settings".
3. Navigate to "Secrets and variables" > "Actions".
4. Click "New repository secret" and add:
   - DOCKER_USERNAME: Your Docker Hub username.
   - DOCKER_PASSWORD: Your Docker Hub password.

.TP
.B Step 4: Create a GitHub Actions Workflow
A workflow is a set of instructions for GitHub Actions.
To create a workflow:
1. In your GitHub repository, create a directory called `.github/workflows`.
2. Inside that directory, create a file named `docker-build.yml`.

.TP
.B Step 5: Define the Workflow
The workflow file contains the steps for building and pushing Docker images.
Here is a sample workflow:

.nf
.B name: Build and Push Docker Image
.on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
.jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Log in to Docker Hub
        uses: docker/login-action@v2
        with:
          username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}
      - name: Build Docker image
        run: |
          docker build -t your-dockerhub-username/your-repo-name:latest .
      - name: Push Docker image
        run: |
          docker push your-dockerhub-username/your-repo-name:latest
.fi

.TP
.B Step 6: Customize the Workflow
Modify the workflow file to match your Docker Hub username and repository name.

.TP
.B Step 7: Commit and Push Changes
After editing the workflow file, save it and push the changes to your GitHub repository.

.TP
.B Step 8: Trigger the Workflow
The workflow will run automatically when you push changes to the specified branch (e.g., `main`). Check the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository for progress.

.TP
.B Step 9: Verify the Docker Image
After the workflow completes, visit your Docker Hub repository to confirm that your Docker image has been pushed successfully.

.SH ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Ensure your Dockerfile is in the correct location or adjust the build command accordingly.
- You can further customize the workflow based on your specific requirements.
